            I am Vlad, and this is my little project that could capture your attention. Firstly, this is my first significant project, and I am grateful for the chance to challenge myself and "force" me to learn more.
            Now, I am going to briefly share my journey:
            So, to be understood, this is my first time interacting with JavaScript and React. Hence, I had to first learn the programming language and then create something with it.
            Friday: For me, Friday was the first day of this challenge. It was the day when I attended the webinar, and I began learning JavaScript (from Codecademy, of course).
            Saturday-Monday: These days were quite similar, just learning the syntax and new ideas from JavaScript. To be honest, on Sunday (on New Year's Eve), I didn't code/learn anything.
            Tuesday: On this day, I finished my JS course, and then I dived straight into React. Unfortunately, I did not implement React on my website. It was too challenging for me. To be honest, I got stuck at merging the code and at JSX.
            Wednesday-Thursday: In these two days, I started to build my webpage. I wanted my website to have an old-styled themed appearance, with black and white graphics and some rolling animations.
            Friday: On this day, I focused just on the API and writing this letter. Regarding the API part, I faced challenges too. I needed to finish my project earlier because of some personal motives (I had something planned a long time during the weekend).
            Problems I encountered:
            I created my website style in Canva. In Canva, if you are a little tricky, you can download a single element and implement it into your website. However, it's not that easy. When I downloaded each single item, I was given a way bigger background, let's say that I had a 20/20px element and a 300/300px "whiteboard." Yes, Canva lets you have a transparent background, but it does not eliminate it. So, when I started to implement those images in code, I noticed that my elements had a big gap in them. Resolution: With the inspect method (Google inspect), I saw the invisible margin, and I started to adjust the important ones and delete the unnecessary ones.
            JSX React was a major problem for me that is still not finished. That's why I made the project just in JavaScript/CSS/HTML.
            The API part, where I couldn't find a result (the code is in InstagramImage.html script part).

            Other cons:
            At the selection page, the images aren't merged with the buttons, making it challenging to hover over them.
            The code is quite messy (mostly in the styling part).
            The project is not finished.
            The non-functionality of the "save," "themes," "start" buttons on the Twitter/Instagram/Story page.
            Things I should add:
            At the page where the user interacts with the code, I should add a button that could transform the output from the AI into the other resolution. For example, I made one design for an Instagram post, now I want, with 2 clicks, to make the same design for a Twitter header.
            That is all I wanted to share about my project. It was a pleasure to work with you guys and to have this opportunity. Maybe our paths will merge together.
            Be with blessings,
            Vlad Chis
